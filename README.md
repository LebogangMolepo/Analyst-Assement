# Analyst-Assement
In this assessment I am tasked to write a function that tests whether a given string is the same when reversed or not.
Palindrome is a word that reads the same backwards as forwards,such as mom, dad, abba,etc.

I am also provided with the apple stock dataset that consists of 6 columns (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
I have observed that the date is released on the 21st of every month and also consists of 31 Stock Historical prices.

On the generic questions I am tasked to investigate what the causes of drop in sale might be and also come up with solutions to this problem
lastly I am tasked to investigate what are the causes of unemployment especially amoongst youth and what could be the solution. 

please see the notebook for the solutions I came up with. Thank you
